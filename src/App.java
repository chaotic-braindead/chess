// a simple chess app using java. i only started reading jswing documentation literally today and OOP hurts my monkey brain so i hope this works haha
// i'm just making this up as i go so don't expect some clean or respectable code lol 
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ChessGUI c = new ChessGUI();        
    }
}
